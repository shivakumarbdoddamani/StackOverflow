# Stack Overflow React Native App

Follow the steps to run the code.

Step 1: Clone the project from github repo.
Step 2: Open it in any code editor (I prefer VS code).
Step 3: Install node_modules by running npm install command in terminal.
Step 4: Open android studio and open the react-native-app/android folder inside it.
Note: Android Studio will automatically start downloading the gradle and build it, which you can see in bottom part of android studio.

Step 5: After gradle files are downloaded and build successfully, go back to the code editor and try to run your app again using

npx react-native run-android

Note: If it shows the same error restart your code editor or laptop and it will work like a charm.
